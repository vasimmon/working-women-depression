  	<p>When the stock market crashed during the 1930s and 1940s, it left millions of Americans out of work. Men struggled to find work again, however womens jobs were a part of the limited group of jobs that were not affected by the stock market crash, otherwise known as the Great Depression. Types of jobs that women had were clerical, domestic service, and factory jobs. These types of jobs were acceptable for women. Many women did have difficulty securing jobs because of job segregation and men disapproving of working women for taking jobs away from them. Because of this, employers were hesitant to hire women and if they did, it was traditionally in a field of work that was socially acceptable for females. These jobs were often underpaid (less than what men would earn) and women were constantly under the threat of having their wages cut. </p>
  	<p>Housekeeping is an example of a job that women had. But they worked under less than ideal conditions. They worked 16-18 hours a day, and sleeping arrangements were not guaranteed. Other domestic jobs were harsh, unpaid, and Jewish men demanded sex from females. Factory workers would also receive sexual harassment on the job as Anna Novak, interviewed by The Federal Writer’s Project notes that women could get along in the workplace if they led the boss smack their ass. Long hours in the factory also meant that women often got backaches.</p>
  	<p>As mentioned before that womens wages were significantly less than mens, women often couldnt afford anything more than the essentials. After securing a place to stay and paying for food, women often couldn’t afford anything else and these jobs failed to create wages that a woman could successfully live on.</p>
  	<p>An example of how women struggled during this time is with Katy Brumby, interviewed by The Federal Writer’s Project. Katy lived alone and without the help of family members she struggled to make ends meet with her sewing job. She needed to pay for fuel, rent, and insurance in addition to paying her neighbors to keep up with her house because she didnt have time to do it. Katy was saving money in any place that she could.</p>
  	<p>Working mothers also faced hardships over worrying if they were making enough money to successfully provide for their children. Sallie Brown, another woman interviewed, noted that she would work by day, and worry by night which sums up motherhood and working women perfectly during the Great Depression.</p>
  	<img src="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/pnp/hec/37100/37100r.jpg "width="700" height="500"> <p>This image shows First Lady Eleanor Rosevelt with a group of working women. Eleanor Rosevelt played a major role during the Depression in supporting and encouraging women to work and make wages for themselves. The image is taken from the Federal Writer's Project with the Library of Congress</p>
  	<p>So why does this scholarship matter? Why is it important to recognize working women during the Great Depression? Because these women started the chain reaction. They influenced succeeding generations to have the desire to work for themselves and change the gender stereotype. For example, the era of ‘Rosie the Riveter’ came shortly after the Depression and many, many women worked to support the war effort. Today, women are present in the workforce just as much as men are. Thanks to working women during the Great Depression and other leading women, females following them achieved the desire to work and to break the gender stereotype. </p>
  	<p>The Federal Writer's Project as mentioned above provides a fantastic source of first hand accounts of individuals that were working during this time. It includes accounts of men, as well as women and mothers. For additional information, click the link above to explore thest first hand accounts. Thank you for taking the time to learn about these incredible working women during the Great Depression and I hope you learn more from the Federal Writer's Project</p>
